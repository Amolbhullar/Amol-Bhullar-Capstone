    "   - Linear & Logistic regression models\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collinearity** refers to the situation when two independent variables are correlated with one another.\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity** is the situation where one independent variable can be expressed as a linear combination of two or more other independent variables (in other words, the independent variables are in a linear relationship with *each other*).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does it do to our models?**\n",
    "\n",
    " - We often see certain independent variables be given much lower coefficients than what the correlation between that variable and the dependent variable would suggest. It may also go against our prior subject matter knowledge.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The coefficient standard errors may also be very high, suggesting that the model is unsure about its prediction.\n",
    " \n",
    " - As a result of both of the above, p-values are likely to be highly skewed, and may lead us to make incorrect conclusions about the significance of the variable. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Why does this happen?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, linear regression models use how an independent variable varies with a dependent variable to estimate the coefficient value that describes the change in the $y$. This is why correlation between the independent variable and dependent variables is important to have. If there is a strong relationship the model can look at the data and say \"Ah, if $x$ increases by 1, then $y$ generally increases by ~2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple linear regression, where we have multiple independent variables, we also need to factor in how the independent variables vary with *each other* as well as the dependent variable. Consider this extreme scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Two independent variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ have very strong correlation with each other, |$\\rho|\\geq 0.9 $\n",
    "   - Both variables variables share strong positive correlation with the dependent $y$, $\\rho \\approx 0.7 $\n",
    "\n",
    "In the scenario above, the model will be unsure about which independent variable is the one that actually driving the relationship with the dependent variable. Ultimately both independent variables seem to move in the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this confusion is that the model will assign the majority of the relationship to one of the variables, and assign little to the other. As a result, one coefficient value will be high and the other very low! This may not match up with what we would expect and lead us to make conclusions about the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable that do not reflect the true relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detecting Collinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Collinearity can be detected by finding the pairwise **correlation** between the independent variables (we typically visualize this as a heatmap). If a linear/logistic regression model is to be fitted, this should always be part of the exploratory phase. If the correlation between some predictors is high, it is a sign of collinearity and we can consider including only one of those predictors in our models (or to combine the information in those predictors some way).\n",
